My name is Jaime, I am a electronics system engineer / software developer / researcher from Spain 🇪🇸 working in Sweden 🇸🇪
At work I'm most passionate about exploring software architectures to improve management and automation ⚙️ of machines. I also enjoy uncovering and fixing problems like my many 🐞
In my spare time I enjoy relaxing.

- 🦸‍♂️ By day I work [@LuleåUniversityofTechnology](https://www.ltu.se/?l=en), where I create all sorts of software systems 🤖 using Agile development practices 🔨, with my main research focus areas being workflow management systems for new automation architectures 🧪.
- 🦹‍♂️ By night I’m currently learning 🌱 [Go](https://go.dev/) and functional programming.
  - 🌲 My "evergreen goals" are: learning and expanding my programming and leadership skills. I am always excited about new challenges, and I want to be ready for anything I might end up doing profesionally in the future. I love learning new stuff, so as Gandhi once said, *"Learn as if you were to live forever"* 📚
